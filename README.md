# Dylan's questionnaire cleansing solution

This is my solution to cleanse questionanire survey results.  This is hosted in AWS, and will take in your results, cleanse and remove duplicated responses, then create an output file.

This solution represents my solution for the DevOps second assessment, as part of my Multiverse degree course.
